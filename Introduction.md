A happiness index is a metric used to measure the well-being and life satisfaction of a population beyond just economic indicators like GDP. Typically, happiness indices incorporate various factors, including physical and mental health, economic stability, social relationships, freedom, and environmental quality. Well-known happiness indices, such as the World Happiness Report, use surveys and data on subjective well-being to rank countries. The idea behind happiness indices is to encourage governments to prioritize policies that improve quality of life rather than focusing solely on economic growth. Bhutanâ€™s Gross National Happiness (GNH) is a notable example, emphasizing sustainability, culture, and good governance as central to its national policy.
